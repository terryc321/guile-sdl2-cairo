# Foreign function experiment

- emscriptem 

is it important to get to the web as fast as possible ? 

how much can emscriptem use ? 

- how good is wasm ?

where can wasm take me ?

- managed to get SDL + CAIRO up and running with a minimal amount of C code , 
does this mean climbed everest for no reason since its undoubtedly slower than what pure C code
would be ?

what is the achievement ? 

flexibililty for sure 

- how can a symbol be documented in guile scheme ?

multiple ideas from all directions 

- common lisp + cl-autowrap - so we can make most/ required library linkage

- guile foreign function features

mainly bytevectors , little else besides int uint int8 uint8 .. etc float double

even with having all ffi completely sorted , actually making something useful or doing anything with the libraries
requires having some understanding of what they do , how to program them so not like home and dry after
climbing the c2ffi compilation hurdle

- parse documentation to get information when writing

in emacs potentially have emacs config no modeline , in a window , which talks through coop-repl-server guile 
then able to redefine functions and see what happens

- T2 SDE on qemu 

can use T2 distro as a 

if able to get xserver working inside a chroot , then almost cracked it .

virtualisation is it able to build the latest clang ?

how much memory should be given to qemu ?

does it slow computer to a clawl crawl cant spell

- why is it so hard to see programming into a hole , to stop fill the hole and start with better approach ?

rather than dig a bigger hole , then back out after ? is it the painful experience to bring joy or encoding ?

- guix as a distro ?

- 


# bindings

c2ffi 

initially only cairo bindings set is being worked on , experiment to extract bindings from documentation rather than c code

- bindings/cairo
- bindings/sdl2
-- sdl
-- sdl-image
-- sdl-ttf
-- sdl-mixer ?
- bindings/sdl3


- bindings/cairo

h is javascript file .
data from c2ffi /usr/include/cairo/cairo.h 

c2ffi can be used as a useful documentation tool as it points to where in actual source file the information is tracked from.
