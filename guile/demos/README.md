Essentially tiny is version made after got stuck trying to understand sdl and cairo.

can be confusing. 

at moment have it so do all cairo drawing, then do the sdl rectangle drawing.

if just do sdl rectangle drawing i need to add a clear screen ,
otherwise cairo drawing handles that for me.

```
events.scm = mouse keyboard window events with SDL and CAIRO graphics , 
essentially all need to get started making an application
```
